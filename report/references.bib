abstract = {We present a novel, incompressible fluid simulation method based on the Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model. In our method, incompressibility is enforced by using a prediction-correction scheme to determine the particle pressures. For this, the information about density fluctuations is actively propagated through the fluid and pressure values are updated until the targeted density is satisfied. With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the WCSPH results.},

abstract = {We propose a new ghost fluid approach for free surface and solid boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) liquid simulations. Prior methods either suffer from a spurious numerical surface tension artifact or drift away from the mass conservation constraint, and do not capture realistic cohesion of liquid to solids. Our Ghost SPH scheme resolves this with a new particle sampling algorithm to create a narrow layer of ghost particles in the surrounding air and solid, with careful extrapolation and treatment of fluid variables to reflect the boundary conditions. We also provide a new, simpler form of artificial viscosity based on XSPH. Examples demonstrate how the new approach captures real liquid behaviour previously unattainable by SPH with very little extra cost.},
